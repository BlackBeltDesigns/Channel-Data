A helper class that compiles all the necessary models to easily gather ExpressionEngine channel data. The main benefit of this library is its ability to be dropped into any existing add-on and retrieve channel data extremely easily without having to load all the models. Another added advantage is the ability to consistently retrieve data throughout all your add-ons.

This project is still very much beta. I am working on documentation on my site, but I have tried to thoroughly document the code itself to make things more clear. Any suggestions or ways to improve this library would be greatly appreciated.
