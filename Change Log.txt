Version 0.3.0 - 11/02/2011
-------------------------
Changed the library significantly yet again in favor of a more module approach based on CodeIgniter's driver object/class schema. 

This also made some headway to implement a Third Party API framework. Developers can now add an API that is easily distinguishable and manageable. This API is designed to interact directly with modules programmatically.

Version 0.2.0 - 10/25/2011
--------------------------
Completely rewrote the Channel Data API in favor a more polymorphic solution. The original API has been deprecated. This project is still clearly very beta.

Version 0.1.0 - 10/07/2011
--------------------------
Initial beta release. Here goes nothing...
